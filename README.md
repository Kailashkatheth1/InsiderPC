# Welcome to the Windows Insider Program for Desktop
Windows Insider Program for Desktop brings you early Windows 10 Technical Preview builds to your PC.
We suggest that you only proceed with the Windows Insider Program if you are only a PC expert, so if you think BIOS is a new plant based fuel, the Windows Insider Program may not be right for you.

To run the Technical Preview, we require the follow specifications:
- A processor which can run at 1GHz or faster
- At least 1GB of RAM for 32 bit builds and 2GB of RAM for 64 bit builds
- 16GB hard disk space
- A Microsoft account and internet access

You will not be able to use your recovery drive once Technical Preview has been installed, so you will not be able to recover your previous operating system without the Windows Installation Disc.

We want feedback, so please post in the Windows Feedback your suggestions and bugs that you find.
